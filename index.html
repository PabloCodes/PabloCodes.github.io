	<h3 style="text-align:center">Kanazawa</h3>
	<p>I was in Kanazawa for 2 days and saw a lot of really cool things. Kanazawa is the capital of the Ishikawa Prefecture which is more or less in the middle of Japan's main island. Kanazawa is well known for its arts because prior to the Meiji Restoration in 1868 the Samurai in the area were relatively wealthy and could afford to be patrons of arts. Kanazawa is specifically known for it's ceramic pottery style, lacquerware and silk dyeing.</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center">Kagaonsen</h3>
	<p>Kagaonsen is a small town that is also in Ishikawa prefecture that I stayed at for a day and a half. This stay was very special, because we were put up in a ryokan--a traditional Japanese inn that typically has tatami matts and sliding doors. They also generally have communal hotspring bathing areas segregated by sex. Our particular ryokan provided traditional japanese clothing for all of its guests, and also had personal hot spring baths in addition to the communal ones. In Kagaonsen we visited a shrine with some absolutely enormous trees. In addition we also observed a local artisan craft wooden bowls on a lathe and walked around the town, exploring every the nook and cranny.(to the extent that my mom tolerated haha) The stay at the ryokan made this stop the highlight of my trip</p>
