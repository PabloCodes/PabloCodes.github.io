			<div class="blurb">True Williams 1876—This illustration of Huck Finn is from the original <span>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span>, and is true to form with Twain’s description of Huckleberry Finn, from the text: “Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing; the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.” (p.30) This depiction seems to validate the townspeople’s negative opinions of Huck, wearing ragged clothes and carrying a dead cat. However, as this is the portrayal of Huck in accordance with <span>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span>, there are considerable differences between this portrayal of Huck, and those based on <span>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span>, perhaps most notably in his clothing, which in most other depictions is considerably less tattered and better fitting.</div>

			<div class="blurb">E.W. Kemble 1884—This depiction of Huck is the frontispiece of the original edition of <span>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span>. It is clear almost immediately that this is a very different Huck than the one we see in <span>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span>. While he still has oversized trousers, they aren’t rolled up or particularly raggedy. The damage to his straw hat is minimal, and the cat he carries in Tom Sawyer is replaced with a rabbit that he likely shot, as there is a gun in his other hand. Although the smile he makes is a little off, on the whole this is a good, if different, depiction of Huck. In comparing the two original frontispieces, Kemble’s composition is better than William’s because there is more light, giving the illustration a more playful feel.</div>

			<div class="blurb">Worth Brehm 1923—This illustration depicts Huck fishing on a log. The illustrator was faithful to descriptions of Huck’s clothing, including his straw hat tattered trousers and ill-fitting shirt. The colors used are warm, but the illustration as a whole is a little dark. Nonetheless, the painting is well composed, and captures a sense of boredom in Huck while he waits for a fish to bite. It appears that Huck has been in this position for quite some time, he is in a relaxed position, and the water is calm judging by his reflection, which indicates a certain lack of movement that relates back to Huck. His reflection in the water is also foreboding of his travels down the Mississippi with Jim, and assigns him a certain easy-going characteristic.</div>

			<div class="blurb">Richard Rogers 1933—This depiction of Huckleberry Finn is also from the scene in <span>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span> where Tom first meets Huck. Here, too, Huck is dressed pretty closely to how he is described in the novel, and has the dead cat with him. However, while William’s depiction of Huck seems more mischievous due to the nonchalance with which he holds the cat, this Huck is fully aware that he carries something out of the ordinary, and is enticing Tom (who is not included in this image but is to the left of Huck) with the possibility of adventure.</div>

			<div class="blurb">Norman Rockwell 1940—This illustration is from the scene where Huck asks Jim to use his hairball to tell him what Pap was going to do. Despite the ridiculousness of the superstition that could seek to degrade Jim, it is clear from the depiction that Huck has a certain respect for Jim and values his opinion, at least insofar as it is beneficial to Huck. Huck is seen looking at Jim intently, seemingly trying to parse how Jim gets the hairball to work. Huck and Jim are both dressed pretty well in this illustration despite their destitution in the actual novel. This seems to be a tactic to make the characters more relatable to their audience, especially when one considers the warm colors used in the painting.</div>

			<div class="blurb">Barry Moser 1985—This is by far the most modern depiction of Huck presented here. In this illustration, Huck has the characteristic oversized clothes, though like many depictions of Huck derived from <span>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span>, they are not tattered. Furthermore, though it is clear that he is young, his countenance relates wisdom beyond his years. This seems to speak to his experience as an outcast. As a pariah, Huck avoided many of the corrupting factors of his society, and was given the opportunity to formulate his own ideas to a greater degree than most others in the society. As a result he was able to befriend Jim and help him to escape north. In this portrayal Jim is dignified, and though his inherent value is called into question by the fact that Huck is positioned directly in front of him, symbolizing his inferior status even to a child, Jim is well dressed and seems comfortable in his current position.</div>
