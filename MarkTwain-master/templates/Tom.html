			<div class="blurb">Williams 1876—This is the frontispiece of the original <span>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span>, and in a sense is the original Tom Sawyer. In this depiction, Tom is in the woods resulting in the dark depiction of Tom. Between the natural shade of the woods, his hat and his roundabout, this depiction of Tom takes on an ominous tone. The portrayal would have been improved by sticking with the speckled straw hat, if only to minimize the amount of shading in the illustration. Furthermore, Tom’s position in the illustration appears uncomfortable, lending to the general uneasiness of this portrayal. </div>

			<div class="blurb">Brehm 1917—This scene portrays Tom piquing Becky Thatcher’s interest by covering up the drawings he is making on his slate. This illustration is an attempt to make Tom endearing to the audience, as it shows him trying to impress his love interest as only a young boy would, by feigning disinterest. One can tell that Tom’s tactic is successful because as he took up a defensive position to hide his drawings, Becky started leaning over towards him. This confirms that she is interested, and also serves to highlight Tom’s cunning, a trait that helps him get out of many tricky situations.</div>

			<div class="blurb">Wyeth 1931—This book wrapper again portrays the whitewashing scene after Tom has passed the brush on to Ben Rogers. Tom is facing the audience in this depiction with the apple Ben traded for the privilege of working on the fence. Tom appears almost guilty, leaning forward and looking down at his feet, as Ben is hard at work just behind him, with several onlookers on the other side of the wrapper. Here, too, the characters have an older quality to them that is more suggestive of teenagers. The fence is also much larger than it was in other depictions. The coloring of this illustration is much less saturated than that of Rockwell’s depiction of the same scene, and seems to lend itself to the expression of guilt that is plain on Toms face.</div>

			<div class="blurb">Rogers 1933—This portrayal of Tom, which is a woodcut, is only half of the piece, the other half is Huck, and will be discussed on Huck’s page. In this woodcut, Tom appears to be older than one would expect, almost teenager. This is largely due to the proportions that his body has. His shoulders are too broad and his facial features are more pronounced than one would expect for a boy. This could be due in part to the medium through which this illustration was made, which relies heavily on the impression of certain characteristics rather than the high level of detail that could be achieved through other more common mediums such as drawing or painting, due to their ability to produce more than just 2 shades. On the whole this is a fine representation of Tom because the clothing is mostly faithful to the book, and it gives a much more adventurous depiction of Tom, making the audience believe that this is a boy that dreams of being a pirate or runs away from home.</div>

			<div class="blurb">Rockwell 1936—This is another version of the whitewashing scene. In this version, which takes place slightly earlier than the other versions here, portrays Tom whitewashing while Ben looks on. Though the audience is aware that Tom is in the process of tricking Ben into doing some of the whitewashing for him, it depicts Tom in a more favorable light than the illustrations that have Tom already reaping the rewards of his successful con. Here, Tom is learning that a situation is what you make of it, and that by giving the outward appearance of enjoying his work he is able to spark the boyhood curiosity of Ben Rogers. Furthermore, the bright colors of this painting also serve to lighten the mood of the illustration.</div>

			<div class="blurb">Benton 1939—In this version of the famous whitewashing scene, we see Tom enjoying the apple that Ben Rogers traded him in exchange for a turn at whitewashing the fence. The composition of this illustration is interesting because of the point of reference one has. Through seeing only the backs of Tom and the other boys, one gets the impression that they are one of the boys who was stopped on their day of freedom by their curiosity, only to get tricked into doing Tom’s work. This portrayal reflects negatively on Tom, because he can be seen lazing about under the tree, with his spoils at his feet while one boy is hard at work on the fence and the other looks to be exhausted, underscoring the exploitative nature of Tom’s actions.</div>
