		<p class="about">Illustrations are an important supplemental resource for many books. In a sense, illustrations tell the reader how to understand certain characters and events. As such, in the cases of <span>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span> and <span>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span>, the illustrations play a large role in determining how certain characters and events are interpreted. Necessarily, then, the illustrations influenced whether these books would be considered primarily children’s books or for a slightly older audience. As there are a decent amount of violent scenes in these novels, especially in <span>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span>, the way those scenes are or are not portrayed help to determine who the target audience is.</p>
		<p class="about">The first illustrators had the benefit of working directly with Mark Twain in order to ensure that the illustrations were up to snuff with the Author’s vision of the characters and events. As the illustrators get further in time from Twain, their interpretations of Tom, Huck and other characters change.  In a sense, part of what makes these boys so iconic is the freedom of interpretation inherent to their beings. In <span>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span>, we don’t get any truly tangible descriptions of what Tom or Huck look like. We get a little information on how they are dressed and, through their reactions to their circumstances, a bit about their personalities as well. However, we are never told what color their hair or eyes are, their stature or body types. This is even more pronounced in <span>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span>, because the story is told in first person, from Huck’s point of view. As a result, the boys can be seen as a more generic archetype of boyhood, allowing the illustrators to modernize the depictions of Tom and Huck while still being faithful to the text.</p>
